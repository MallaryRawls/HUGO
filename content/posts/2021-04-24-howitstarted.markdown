## How It Started 

Starting out was very difficult when trying to find and decide on an corpus to use for this project. I'm in the beginning stages of my thesis and still trying to figure out my research, what's interesting to me, and what I can write about. It has also been a difficult process to get the website up and running. This project has started out slow and it continues to evolve slowly. I started out wanting to use the National Association of Colored Women's (NACW) historical papers as my corpus and I was able to find their papers through HathiTrust and through the Library of Congress. When I started thinking about what it is I wanted to do with those papers and how it can relate to digital humanities, I encountered my first set of problems. I couldn't think through what exactly I wanted to do with those papers and how using digitial humanities tools could help the process, so I changed course and decided I wanted to use The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) papers and write about their influenece over pedagogy used for children post-Reconstuction Era. I decided on using Susan Bradford Eppes' diary *Through Some Eventful Years* (1926) and some texts written by Mildred Lewis Rutherford that were published in 1919 and 1920.

## How It's Going 

Switching to using the UDC papers and thinking about Reconstruction Era pedagogy and how to use those sources with digitial humanities tools seems to be going well. It's still difficult for me to think through how my research into Reconstruction Era pedagogy interacts with DH tools, but it's slowly coming together. My hope is to: 
- look through multiple texts that the UDC recommends and discourages 
- look at the difference in pepdagogy taught to white children in comparison to pepdagogy taught to Black children and eventually Indigenous/Asian/children
- look at historical pedagogical practices in different time periods to see if there's any progress and where it's made

Ultimately my goal is to arrive at a place where I'm looking at how Reconstruction is taught to children today, how it differs (or doesn't), and look for a social impact. I'm hoping that my research will center on historical Reconstruction pedagogy so we know the course of how Reconstruction has been taught to see how we got where we're at and how to move forward. I would love for my research to go into a direction where I can look at local/state/federal education policy, especially when it comes down to social studies in K-12 education in the United States. My hypothesis is that we don't teach Reconstruction well or at all and that has implications for how students think about the Civil War and American history. This is all very early and I don't know exactly what direction my thesis will take, but I plan on updating and using this website as a way for me to keep track of my research.
