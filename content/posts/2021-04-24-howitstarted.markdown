## How It Started 

Trying to find and decide on an corpus to use for this project was a difficult process. I'm in the beginning stages of my thesis and still trying to figure out my research, what's interesting to me, and what I can really write about. It has also been a difficult process to get the website up and running. This project has started out slow and it continues to evolve slowly. I started out wanting to use the National Association of Colored Women's historical papers as my corpus. I was able to find their papers through HathiTrust and through the Library of Congress. When I started thinking about what it is I wanted to do with those papers and how it can relate to digital humanities, I encountered my first set of problems. I changed course and then decided I wanted to use The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) papers and write about their influenece over pedagogy used for children post-Reconstuction Era. I decided on using Susan Bradford Eppes' diary *Through Some Eventful Years* (1926) and some texts written by Mildred Lewis Rutherford that were published in 1919 and 1920.
