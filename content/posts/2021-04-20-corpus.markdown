### Susan Bradford Eppes, *Through Some Eventful Years* (Georgia: J. W. Burke Company, 1926), 383. 

Eppes' textbook is the published diary of Susan Bradford Eppes. Eppes work is a useful tool due to her depiction of the Civil War and Reconstruction Era and her life in Tallahassee, Florida during this time period. She provides an honest account of her life and this is a text Rutherford would find useful in teaching Lost Cause pedagogy. 

### Mildred Lewis Rutherford, *Truths of History* (Georgia, 1920), 149. 

### Mildred Lewis Rutherford, *A Measuring Rod To Test Text Books, and Reference Books in Schools, Colleages and Libraries* (Georgia, 1919), 33. 

### Other Texts I'd like to Use
